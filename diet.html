                    <p>While calories and macronutrients are important, the ideal gym diet must be one that positively
                        influences health. This is a diet that is rich in vitamins and minerals where all three
                        macronutrients are consumed and nutrient-sparse foods are restricted.

                    <p>On the whole, the above guide will prove to be useful, yet be aware that when it comes to
                        nutrition, everyone is different. Not only will physical attributes determine your nutritional
                        requirements, the goals that you have set will also influence your diet.
                        For example, two goals that are extremely common are fat loss and muscle growth. So, in order to
                        lose fat, calories must be restricted which will cause stored body fat to be broken down. On the
                        other hand, as for muscle growth, calorie intake must be increased to build significant muscle
                        size as additional calories are required to accelerate the recovery process. A gym diet plan
                        must be a combination of micro and macro nutrients.
                        Meanwhile, macro-nutrient demands for both fat loss and muscle growth are similar. Firstly,
                        protein intake should remain high for both. For muscle growth, protein is evidently required for
                        building mass. Hence, the role of protein in fat loss is to prevent muscle tissue breakdown as
                        far as possible.
                        So, carbohydrates are extremely important in energy and replenishment. Therefore, those looking
                        to lose weight and build muscle should get the majority of their calories from carb sources.
